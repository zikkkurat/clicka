1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,536
Chris Anderson:
Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,936
It's great to have you here.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,536
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,416
CA: So, in the next half hour or so,

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,256
we're going to spend some time

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,176
exploring your vision for what
an exciting future might look like,

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,296
which I guess makes
the first question a little ironic:

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,056
Why are you boring?

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,296
EM: Yeah.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,870
I ask myself that frequently.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,376
We're trying to dig a hole under LA,

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,576
and this is to create the beginning

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,720
of what will hopefully
be a 3D network of tunnels

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,736
to alleviate congestion.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,296
So right now, one of the most
soul-destroying things is traffic.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,176
It affects people
in every part of the world.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,016
It takes away so much of your life.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,016
It's horrible.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,656
It's particularly horrible in LA.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,336
(Laughter)

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,296
CA: I think you've brought with you

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,775
the first visualization
that's been shown of this.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,136
Can I show this?

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,856
EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time --

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,736
Just to show what we're talking about.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,896
So a couple of key things
that are important

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,816
in having a 3D tunnel network.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,456
First of all, you have to be able

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,736
to integrate the entrance
and exit of the tunnel

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,816
seamlessly into the fabric of the city.

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,496
So by having an elevator,

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,296
sort of a car skate,
that's on an elevator,

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,256
you can integrate the entrance
and exits to the tunnel network

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
just by using two parking spaces.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,936
And then the car gets on a skate.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,336
There's no speed limit here,

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,376
so we're designing this to be able
to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,616
CA: How much?

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,960
EM: 200 kilometers an hour,
or about 130 miles per hour.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,016
So you should be able
to get from, say, Westwood to LAX

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,296
in six minutes -- five, six minutes.

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,656
(Applause)

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,256
CA: So possibly, initially done,

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,576
it's like on a sort
of toll road-type basis.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,816
EM: Yeah.

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,896
CA: Which, I guess,
alleviates some traffic

47
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,616
from the surface streets as well.

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,256
EM: So, I don't know
if people noticed it in the video,

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,416
but there's no real limit
to how many levels of tunnel you can have.

50
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,256
You can go much further deep
than you can go up.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,456
The deepest mines are much deeper
than the tallest buildings are tall,

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,736
so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,056
with a 3D tunnel network.

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,616
This is a very important point.

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,016
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
is that if you add one layer of tunnels,

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,816
that will simply alleviate congestion,
it will get used up,

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,136
and then you'll be back where you started,
back with congestion.

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,576
But you can go to any
arbitrary number of tunnels,

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,936
any number of levels.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,496
CA: But people -- seen traditionally,
it's incredibly expensive to dig,

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,296
and that would block this idea.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,016
EM: Yeah.

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,256
Well, they're right.

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,056
To give you an example,
the LA subway extension,

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,736
which is -- I think it's
a two-and-a-half mile extension

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,999
that was just completed
for two billion dollars.

67
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:29,416
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile
to do the subway extension in LA.

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,416
And this is not the highest
utility subway in the world.

69
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,936
So yeah, it's quite difficult
to dig tunnels normally.

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,136
I think we need to have
at least a tenfold improvement

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,480
in the cost per mile of tunneling.

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,840
CA: And how could you achieve that?

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,296
EM: Actually, if you just do two things,

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,656
you can get to approximately
an order of magnitude improvement,

75
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,856
and I think you can go beyond that.

76
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,136
So the first thing to do
is to cut the tunnel diameter

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,776
by a factor of two or more.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,776
So a single road lane tunnel
according to regulations

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,656
has to be 26 feet,
maybe 28 feet in diameter

80
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,856
to allow for crashes
and emergency vehicles

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,136
and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,736
But if you shrink that diameter
to what we're attempting,

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,416
which is 12 feet, which is plenty
to get an electric skate through,

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,656
you drop the diameter by a factor of two

85
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,576
and the cross-sectional area
by a factor of four,

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,456
and the tunneling cost scales
with the cross-sectional area.

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,696
So that's roughly a half-order
of magnitude improvement right there.

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,616
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
for half the time, then they stop,

89
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,816
and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements

90
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,136
for the tunnel wall.

91
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,376
So if you design the machine instead

92
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,736
to do continuous
tunneling and reinforcing,

93
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,976
that will give you
a factor of two improvement.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,216
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.

95
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,896
Also these machines are far from being
at their power or thermal limits,

96
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,976
so you can jack up the power
to the machine substantially.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,136
I think you can get
at least a factor of two,

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,336
maybe a factor of four or five
improvement on top of that.

99
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,576
So I think there's a fairly
straightforward series of steps

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,576
to get somewhere in excess
of an order of magnitude improvement

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,336
in the cost per mile,

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,296
and our target actually is --

103
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,136
we've got a pet snail called Gary,

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,696
this is from Gary the snail
from "South Park,"

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,656
I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,256
(Laughter)

107
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,696
So Gary is capable of --

108
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,816
currently he's capable
of going 14 times faster

109
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,616
than a tunnel-boring machine.

110
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,416
(Laughter)

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,216
CA: You want to beat Gary.

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,536
EM: We want to beat Gary.

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,096
(Laughter)

114
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,336
He's not a patient little fellow,

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,456
and that will be victory.

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,880
Victory is beating the snail.

117
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,336
CA: But a lot of people imagining,
dreaming about future cities,

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,256
they imagine that actually
the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.

119
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,496
You go aboveground.

120
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,336
Why isn't that a better solution?

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,336
You save all that tunneling cost.

122
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,576
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,456
Obviously, I do rockets,
so I like things that fly.

124
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,416
This is not some inherent bias
against flying things,

125
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,496
but there is a challenge with flying cars

126
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,816
in that they'll be quite noisy,

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
the wind force generated
will be very high.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,696
Let's just say that if something's
flying over your head,

129
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
a whole bunch of flying cars
going all over the place,

130
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,056
that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.

131
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
(Laughter)

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,760
You don't think to yourself,
"Well, I feel better about today."

133
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,136
You're thinking,
"Did they service their hubcap,

134
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,056
or is it going to come off
and guillotine me?"

135
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,760
Things like that.

136
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,896
CA: So you've got this vision

137
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,216
of future cities with these rich,
3D networks of tunnels underneath.

138
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,256
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?

139
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,816
Could you apply these tunnels
to use for this Hyperloop idea

140
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,221
you released a few years ago.

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,056
EM: Yeah, so we've been
sort of puttering around

142
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,696
with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.

143
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,536
We built a Hyperloop test track
adjacent to SpaceX,

144
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,696
just for a student competition,

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,736
to encourage innovative
ideas in transport.

146
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,776
And it actually ends up being
the biggest vacuum chamber in the world

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
after the Large Hadron Collider,

148
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
by volume.

149
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,776
So it was quite fun to do that,
but it was kind of a hobby thing,

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,496
and then we think we might --

151
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,880
so we've built a little pusher car
to push the student pods,

152
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,376
but we're going to try seeing
how fast we can make the pusher go

153
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,829
if it's not pushing something.

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,056
So we're cautiously optimistic

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,096
we'll be able to be faster
than the world's fastest bullet train

156
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,376
even in a .8-mile stretch.

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,936
CA: Whoa. Good brakes.

158
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,216
EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.

159
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,856
It's either going to smash
into tiny pieces or go quite fast.

160
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,456
CA: But you can picture,
then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel

161
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,296
running quite long distances.

162
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,016
EM: Exactly.

163
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,816
And looking at tunneling technology,

164
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,376
it turns out that
in order to make a tunnel,

165
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
you have to --

166
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,696
In order to seal against the water table,

167
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,376
you've got to typically design
a tunnel wall to be good

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,720
to about five or six atmospheres.

169
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,176
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,616
or near-vacuum.

171
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,056
So actually, it sort of turns out
that automatically,

172
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,056
if you build a tunnel that is good enough
to resist the water table,

173
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,496
it is automatically
capable of holding vacuum.

174
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,136
CA: Huh.

175
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,696
EM: So, yeah.

176
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,576
CA: And so you could actually picture,

177
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,296
what kind of length tunnel
is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?

178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,536
EM: I think there's no real length limit.

179
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,576
You could dig as much as you want.

180
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,816
I think if you were to do something

181
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,016
like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,

182
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,896
I think you'd probably want
to go underground the entire way

183
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,536
because it's a high-density area.

184
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,616
You're going under
a lot of buildings and houses,

185
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,176
and if you go deep enough,

186
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,576
you cannot detect the tunnel.

187
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,536
Sometimes people think,
well, it's going to be pretty annoying

188
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,416
to have a tunnel dug under my house.

189
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,776
Like, if that tunnel is dug

190
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,976
more than about three or four
tunnel diameters beneath your house,

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,880
you will not be able
to detect it being dug at all.

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,576
In fact, if you're able
to detect the tunnel being dug,

193
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,216
whatever device you are using,

194
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,506
you can get a lot of money
for that device from the Israeli military,

195
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,326
who is trying to detect
tunnels from Hamas,

196
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:12,416
and from the US Customs and Border patrol
that try and detect drug tunnels.

197
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,656
So the reality is

198
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,536
that earth is incredibly good
at absorbing vibrations,

199
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,536
and once the tunnel depth
is below a certain level,

200
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,536
it is undetectable.

201
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,136
Maybe if you have a very sensitive
seismic instrument,

202
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,640
you might be able to detect it.

203
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,656
CA: So you've started
a new company to do this

204
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,376
called The Boring Company.

205
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,336
Very nice. Very funny.

206
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,736
(Laughter)

207
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,256
EM: What's funny about that?

208
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,896
(Laughter)

209
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,840
CA: How much of your time is this?

210
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,720
EM: It's maybe ...

211
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,880
two or three percent.

212
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,856
CA: You've called it a hobby.

213
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,496
This is what an Elon Musk
hobby looks like.

214
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,536
(Laughter)

215
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,016
EM: I mean, it really is, like --

216
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
This is basically interns
and people doing it part time.

217
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,016
We bought some second-hand machinery.

218
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,160
It's kind of puttering along,
but it's making good progress, so --

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,896
CA: So an even bigger part of your time

220
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,200
is being spent on electrifying
cars and transport through Tesla.

221
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,016
Is one of the motivations
for the tunneling project

222
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,576
the realization that actually,

223
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,016
in a world where cars are electric
and where they're self-driving,

224
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,576
there may end up being
more cars on the roads

225
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,976
on any given hour than there are now?

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
EM: Yeah, exactly.

227
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,336
A lot of people think
that when you make cars autonomous,

228
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,976
they'll be able to go faster
and that will alleviate congestion.

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,896
And to some degree that will be true,

230
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,976
but once you have shared autonomy
where it's much cheaper to go by car

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
and you can go point to point,

232
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,096
the affordability of going in a car
will be better than that of a bus.

233
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,336
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.

234
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,416
So the amount of driving that will occur
will be much greater with shared autonomy,

235
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,296
and actually traffic will get far worse.

236
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,576
CA: You started Tesla
with the goal of persuading the world

237
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,736
that electrification
was the future of cars,

238
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,136
and a few years ago,
people were laughing at you.

239
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,616
Now, not so much.

240
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,856
EM: OK.

241
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,816
(Laughter)

242
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,056
I don't know. I don't know.

243
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,496
CA: But isn't it true that pretty much
every auto manufacturer

244
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,536
has announced
serious electrification plans

245
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
for the short- to medium-term future?

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,256
I think almost every automaker
has some electric vehicle program.

248
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,536
They vary in seriousness.

249
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,856
Some are very serious
about transitioning entirely to electric,

250
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,240
and some are just dabbling in it.

251
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,696
And some, amazingly,
are still pursuing fuel cells,

252
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,856
but I think that won't last much longer.

253
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,936
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,

254
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,656
where you can now just declare victory
and say, you know, "We did it."

255
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,760
Let the world electrify,
and you go on and focus on other stuff?

256
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,720
EM: Yeah.

257
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,896
I intend to stay with Tesla
as far into the future as I can imagine,

258
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,576
and there are a lot of exciting
things that we have coming.

259
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,776
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.

260
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,200
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.

261
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,056
CA: OK, we're going to come to this.

262
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,056
So Model 3, it's supposed
to be coming in July-ish.

263
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,616
EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good
for starting production in July.

264
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,016
CA: Wow.

265
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,416
One of the things
that people are so excited about

266
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,656
is the fact that it's got autopilot.

267
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,016
And you put out this video a while back

268
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,376
showing what that technology
would look like.

269
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,616
EM: Yeah.

270
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,126
CA: There's obviously autopilot
in Model S right now.

271
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,536
What are we seeing here?

272
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,576
EM: Yeah, so this is using
only cameras and GPS.

273
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,096
So there's no LIDAR
or radar being used here.

274
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,160
This is just using passive optical,
which is essentially what a person uses.

275
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,696
The whole road system
is meant to be navigated

276
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,776
with passive optical, or cameras,

277
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,136
and so once you solve cameras

278
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,400
or vision,

279
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,216
then autonomy is solved.

280
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,520
If you don't solve vision,
it's not solved.

281
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,136
So that's why our focus is
so heavily on having a vision neural net

282
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,376
that's very effective for road conditions.

283
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,016
CA: Right. Many other people
are going the LIDAR route.

284
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,896
You want cameras plus radar is most of it.

285
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,296
EM: You can absolutely
be superhuman with just cameras.

286
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,336
Like, you can probably do it
ten times better than humans would,

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,616
just cameras.

288
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,096
CA: So the new cars being sold right now
have eight cameras in them.

289
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,456
They can't yet do what that showed.

290
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,120
When will they be able to?

291
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,176
EM: I think we're still on track
for being able to go cross-country

292
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,376
from LA to New York by the end
of the year, fully autonomous.

293
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,176
CA: OK, so by the end
of the year, you're saying,

294
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,176
someone's going to sit in a Tesla
without touching the steering wheel,

295
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,696
tap in "New York," off it goes.

296
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,936
EM: Yeah.

297
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,160
CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --
by the end of 2017.

298
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,896
EM: Yeah. Essentially,
November or December of this year,

299
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,336
we should be able to go all the way
from a parking lot in California

300
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,016
to a parking lot in New York,

301
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,880
no controls touched at any point
during the entire journey.

302
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,816
(Applause)

303
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,056
CA: Amazing.

304
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,496
But part of that is possible

305
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,936
because you've already got a fleet
of Teslas driving all these roads.

306
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,760
You're accumulating a huge amount
of data of that national road system.

307
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,096
EM: Yes, but the thing
that will be interesting

308
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,200
is that I'm actually fairly confident
it will be able to do that route

309
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,200
even if you change the route dynamically.

310
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,240
So, it's fairly easy --

311
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,776
If you say I'm going to be really good
at one specific route, that's one thing,

312
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,936
but it should be able to go,
really be very good,

313
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,696
certainly once you enter a highway,

314
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,496
to go anywhere on the highway system

315
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,760
in a given country.

316
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,336
So it's not sort of limited
to LA to New York.

317
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,816
We could change it
and make it Seattle-Florida,

318
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,376
that day, in real time.

319
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,536
So you were going from LA to New York.

320
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,280
Now go from LA to Toronto.

321
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,056
CA: So leaving aside
regulation for a second,

322
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,856
in terms of the technology alone,

323
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,696
the time when someone
will be able to buy one of your cars

324
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,536
and literally just take the hands
off the wheel and go to sleep

325
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,616
and wake up and find that they've arrived,

326
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,576
how far away is that, to do that safely?

327
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,856
EM: I think that's about two years.

328
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,256
So the real trick of it
is not how do you make it work

329
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,215
say 99.9 percent of the time,

330
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,336
because, like, if a car crashes
one in a thousand times,

331
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,336
then you're probably still not going
to be comfortable falling asleep.

332
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,040
You shouldn't be, certainly.

333
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,540
(Laughter)

334
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,935
It's never going to be perfect.

335
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,695
No system is going to be perfect,

336
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,319
but if you say it's perhaps --

337
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,936
the car is unlikely to crash

338
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,416
in a hundred lifetimes,
or a thousand lifetimes,

339
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,336
then people are like, OK, wow,
if I were to live a thousand lives,

340
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,976
I would still most likely
never experience a crash,

341
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,376
then that's probably OK.

342
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,616
CA: To sleep.

343
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,496
I guess the big concern of yours
is that people may actually

344
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,816
get seduced too early
to think that this is safe,

345
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,376
and that you'll have some horrible
incident happen that puts things back.

346
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,416
EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system
is likely to at least mitigate the crash,

347
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,920
except in rare circumstances.

348
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,576
The thing to appreciate
about vehicle safety

349
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,000
is this is probabilistic.

350
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,376
I mean, there's some chance that any time
a human driver gets in a car,

351
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,336
that they will have an accident
that is their fault.

352
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,680
It's never zero.

353
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,816
So really the key threshold for autonomy

354
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,256
is how much better does autonomy
need to be than a person

355
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,656
before you can rely on it?

356
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,096
CA: But once you get
literally safe hands-off driving,

357
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,936
the power to disrupt
the whole industry seems massive,

358
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,336
because at that point you've spoken
of people being able to buy a car,

359
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,496
drops you off at work,
and then you let it go

360
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,496
and provide a sort of Uber-like
service to other people,

361
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,736
earn you money,

362
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,216
maybe even cover the cost
of your lease of that car,

363
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,096
so you can kind of get a car for free.

364
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,376
Is that really likely?

365
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,256
EM: Yeah. Absolutely
this is what will happen.

366
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,256
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet

367
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,536
where you buy your car

368
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,976
and you can choose
to use that car exclusively,

369
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,696
you could choose to have it be used
only by friends and family,

370
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,776
only by other drivers
who are rated five star,

371
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,680
you can choose to share it sometimes
but not other times.

372
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,416
That's 100 percent what will occur.

373
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,821
It's just a question of when.

374
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,176
CA: Wow.

375
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,416
So you mentioned the Semi

376
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,176
and I think you're planning
to announce this in September,

377
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,296
but I'm curious whether there's
anything you could show us today?

378
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,176
EM: I will show you
a teaser shot of the truck.

379
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,696
(Laughter)

380
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,656
It's alive.

381
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,896
CA: OK.

382
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,616
EM: That's definitely a case
where we want to be cautious

383
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,974
about the autonomy features.

384
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,576
Yeah.

385
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,216
(Laughter)

386
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,856
CA: We can't see that much of it,

387
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,096
but it doesn't look like
just a little friendly neighborhood truck.

388
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,376
It looks kind of badass.

389
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,560
What sort of semi is this?

390
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,736
EM: So this is a heavy duty,
long-range semitruck.

391
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,016
So it's the highest weight capability

392
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,096
and with long range.

393
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,560
So essentially it's meant to alleviate
the heavy-duty trucking loads.

394
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,576
And this is something which
people do not today think is possible.

395
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,336
They think the truck doesn't have enough
power or it doesn't have enough range,

396
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,896
and then with the Tesla Semi

397
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,576
we want to show that no, an electric truck

398
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,616
actually can out-torque any diesel semi.

399
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,776
And if you had a tug-of-war competition,

400
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,856
the Tesla Semi
will tug the diesel semi uphill.

401
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,136
(Laughter)

402
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,016
(Applause)

403
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,056
CA: That's pretty cool.
And short term, these aren't driverless.

404
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,400
These are going to be trucks
that truck drivers want to drive.

405
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,096
EM: Yes. So what will be
really fun about this

406
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,496
is you have a flat torque RPM curve
with an electric motor,

407
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,016
whereas with a diesel motor or any kind
of internal combustion engine car,

408
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,640
you've got a torque RPM curve
that looks like a hill.

409
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,776
So this will be a very spry truck.

410
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,656
You can drive this
around like a sports car.

411
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,056
There's no gears.
It's, like, single speed.

412
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,536
CA: There's a great movie
to be made here somewhere.

413
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,336
I don't know what it is
and I don't know that it ends well,

414
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,576
but it's a great movie.

415
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,616
(Laughter)

416
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,376
EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.

417
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,416
When I was driving the test prototype
for the first truck.

418
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,696
It's really weird,
because you're driving around

419
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,816
and you're just so nimble,
and you're in this giant truck.

420
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,336
CA: Wait, you've
already driven a prototype?

421
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,456
EM: Yeah, I drove it
around the parking lot,

422
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,936
and I was like, this is crazy.

423
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,136
CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.

424
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,256
EM: It's just like,
driving this giant truck

425
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,256
and making these mad maneuvers.

426
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,736
CA: This is cool.
OK, from a really badass picture

427
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,376
to a kind of less badass picture.

428
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,736
This is just a cute house
from "Desperate Housewives" or something.

429
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,816
What on earth is going on here?

430
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,296
EM: Well, this illustrates
the picture of the future

431
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,296
that I think is how things will evolve.

432
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,656
You've got an electric car
in the driveway.

433
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,416
If you look in between
the electric car and the house,

434
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,296
there are actually three Powerwalls
stacked up against the side of the house,

435
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,136
and then that house roof is a solar roof.

436
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,256
So that's an actual solar glass roof.

437
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,496
CA: OK.

438
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,776
EM: That's a picture of a real --
well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.

439
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,456
That's a real fake house.

440
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,576
(Laughter)

441
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,456
CA: So these roof tiles,

442
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,616
some of them have in them
basically solar power, the ability to --

443
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,336
EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles

444
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,456
where you can adjust
the texture and the color

445
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,456
to a very fine-grained level,

446
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,056
and then there's
sort of microlouvers in the glass,

447
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,536
such that when you're looking
at the roof from street level

448
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,256
or close to street level,

449
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,656
all the tiles look the same

450
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,760
whether there is a solar cell
behind it or not.

451
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,416
So you have an even color

452
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,936
from the ground level.

453
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,056
If you were to look at it
from a helicopter,

454
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,456
you would be actually able
to look through and see

455
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,496
that some of the glass tiles have
a solar cell behind them and some do not.

456
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,136
You can't tell from street level.

457
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,216
CA: You put them in the ones
that are likely to see a lot of sun,

458
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,616
and that makes these roofs
super affordable, right?

459
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,616
They're not that much more expensive
than just tiling the roof.

460
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,840
EM: Yeah.

461
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,440
We're very confident
that the cost of the roof

462
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,760
plus the cost of electricity --

463
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,856
A solar glass roof will be less
than the cost of a normal roof

464
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,296
plus the cost of electricity.

465
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,576
So in other words,

466
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,936
this will be economically a no-brainer,

467
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,656
we think it will look great,

468
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,816
and it will last --

469
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,896
We thought about having
the warranty be infinity,

470
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,136
but then people thought,

471
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,736
well, that might sound
like were just talking rubbish,

472
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,376
but actually this is toughened glass.

473
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,296
Well after the house has collapsed

474
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,216
and there's nothing there,

475
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,776
the glass tiles will still be there.

476
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,376
(Applause)

477
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,136
CA: I mean, this is cool.

478
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,016
So you're rolling this out
in a couple week's time, I think,

479
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,576
with four different roofing types.

480
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,136
EM: Yeah, we're starting off
with two, two initially,

481
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,336
and the second two
will be introduced early next year.

482
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,416
CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?

483
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
How many houses do you believe
could end up having this type of roofing?

484
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,160
EM: I think eventually

485
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,200
almost all houses will have a solar roof.

486
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,416
The thing is to consider
the time scale here

487
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,896
to be probably on the order

488
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,096
of 40 or 50 years.

489
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,000
So on average, a roof
is replaced every 20 to 25 years.

490
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,736
But you don't start replacing
all roofs immediately.

491
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,096
But eventually,
if you say were to fast-forward

492
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,576
to say 15 years from now,

493
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,200
it will be unusual to have a roof
that does not have solar.

494
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,696
CA: Is there a mental model thing
that people don't get here

495
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,136
that because of the shift in the cost,
the economics of solar power,

496
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,256
most houses actually have
enough sunlight on their roof

497
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,336
pretty much to power all of their needs.

498
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,256
If you could capture the power,

499
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,336
it could pretty much
power all their needs.

500
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,896
You could go off-grid, kind of.

501
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,456
EM: It depends on where you are

502
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,736
and what the house size is
relative to the roof area,

503
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,616
but it's a fair statement to say

504
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,456
that most houses in the US
have enough roof area

505
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,440
to power all the needs of the house.

506
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,976
CA: So the key to the economics

507
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,016
of the cars, the Semi, of these houses

508
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,936
is the falling price
of lithium-ion batteries,

509
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,456
which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.

510
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,736
In many ways, that's almost
the core competency.

511
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,016
And you've decided

512
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,256
that to really, like, own that competency,

513
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,736
you just have to build
the world's largest manufacturing plant

514
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,896
to double the world's supply
of lithium-ion batteries,

515
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,216
with this guy. What is this?

516
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,696
EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,

517
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,416
progress so far on the Gigafactory.

518
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,336
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see

519
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,296
that there's sort of
a diamond shape overall,

520
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,936
and when it's fully done,
it'll look like a giant diamond,

521
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,176
or that's the idea behind it,

522
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,696
and it's aligned on true north.

523
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,456
It's a small detail.

524
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,376
CA: And capable of producing, eventually,

525
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,576
like a hundred gigawatt hours
of batteries a year.

526
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,576
EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.
We think probably more, but yeah.

527
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,976
CA: And they're actually
being produced right now.

528
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,176
EM: They're in production already.
CA: You guys put out this video.

529
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,536
I mean, is that speeded up?

530
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,256
EM: That's the slowed down version.

531
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,056
(Laughter)

532
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,416
CA: How fast does it actually go?

533
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,256
EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,

534
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,216
you can't actually see the cells
without a strobe light.

535
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,440
It's just blur.

536
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,876
(Laughter)

537
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,576
CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,
about what makes an exciting future

538
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,240
is a future where we no longer
feel guilty about energy.

539
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,896
Help us picture this.

540
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,936
How many Gigafactories, if you like,
does it take to get us there?

541
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,696
EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.

542
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,456
It's not 10, it's not a thousand.

543
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,840
Most likely a hundred.

544
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,696
CA: See, I find this amazing.

545
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,696
You can picture what it would take

546
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,976
to move the world
off this vast fossil fuel thing.

547
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,576
It's like you're building one,

548
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,456
it costs five billion dollars,

549
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,616
or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.

550
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,256
Like, it's kind of cool
that you can picture that project.

551
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,760
And you're planning to do, at Tesla --
announce another two this year.

552
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,336
EM: I think we'll announce locations

553
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,096
for somewhere between two
and four Gigafactories later this year.

554
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,560
Yeah, probably four.

555
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,656
CA: Whoa.

556
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,296
(Applause)

557
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,376
No more teasing from you for here?

558
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,200
Like -- where, continent?

559
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,680
You can say no.

560
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,216
EM: We need to address a global market.

561
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,456
CA: OK.

562
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,816
(Laughter)

563
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,040
This is cool.

564
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,720
I think we should talk for --

565
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,176
Actually, global market.

566
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,296
I'm going to ask you one question
about politics, only one.

567
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,576
I'm kind of sick of politics,
but I do want to ask you this.

568
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,936
You're on a body now
giving advice to a guy --

569
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,176
EM: Who?

570
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,096
CA: Who has said he doesn't
really believe in climate change,

571
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,456
and there's a lot of people out there
who think you shouldn't be doing that.

572
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,376
They'd like you to walk away from that.

573
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,760
What would you say to them?

574
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,336
EM: Well, I think that first of all,

575
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,896
I'm just on two advisory councils

576
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,736
where the format consists
of going around the room

577
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,656
and asking people's opinion on things,

578
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,440
and so there's like a meeting
every month or two.

579
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,776
That's the sum total of my contribution.

580
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,576
But I think to the degree
that there are people in the room

581
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,336
who are arguing in favor
of doing something about climate change,

582
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,360
or social issues,

583
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,736
I've used the meetings I've had thus far

584
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,616
to argue in favor of immigration
and in favor of climate change.

585
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,576
(Applause)

586
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,696
And if I hadn't done that,

587
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,536
that wasn't on the agenda before.

588
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,800
So maybe nothing will happen,
but at least the words were said.

589
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,896
CA: OK.

590
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,800
(Applause)

591
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,336
So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.

592
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,816
Last time you were here,

593
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,536
you spoke about what seemed like
a kind of incredibly ambitious dream

594
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,856
to develop rockets
that were actually reusable.

595
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,016
And you've only gone and done it.

596
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,656
EM: Finally. It took a long time.

597
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,256
CA: Talk us through this.
What are we looking at here?

598
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,416
EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters

599
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,016
coming back from
very high and fast in space.

600
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,296
So just delivered the upper stage

601
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,416
at high velocity.

602
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,296
I think this might have been
at sort of Mach 7 or so,

603
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,280
delivery of the upper stage.

604
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
(Applause)

605
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,336
CA: So that was a sped-up --

606
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,176
EM: That was the slowed down version.

607
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,536
(Laughter)

608
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,056
CA: I thought that was
the sped-up version.

609
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,416
But I mean, that's amazing,

610
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,776
and several of these failed

611
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,736
before you finally
figured out how to do it,

612
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,656
but now you've done this,
what, five or six times?

613
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,976
EM: We're at eight or nine.

614
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,616
CA: And for the first time,

615
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,776
you've actually reflown
one of the rockets that landed.

616
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,576
EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster

617
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,216
and then prepped it for flight again
and flew it again,

618
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,416
so it's the first reflight
of an orbital booster

619
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,416
where that reflight is relevant.

620
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,616
So it's important to appreciate
that reusability is only relevant

621
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,720
if it is rapid and complete.

622
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,656
So like an aircraft or a car,

623
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,056
the reusability is rapid and complete.

624
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,136
You do not send your aircraft
to Boeing in-between flights.

625
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,976
CA: Right. So this is allowing you
to dream of this really ambitious idea

626
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,176
of sending many, many, many people to Mars

627
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,616
in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.

628
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,016
EM: Yeah.

629
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,456
CA: And you've designed
this outrageous rocket to do it.

630
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,896
Help us understand
the scale of this thing.

631
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,800
EM: Well, visually
you can see that's a person.

632
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,496
Yeah, and that's the vehicle.

633
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,176
(Laughter)

634
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,936
CA: So if that was a skyscraper,

635
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,296
that's like, did I read that,
a 40-story skyscraper?

636
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,920
EM: Probably a little more, yeah.

637
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,360
The thrust level of this is really --

638
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,280
This configuration is about four times
the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.

639
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,296
CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest
rocket humanity ever created before.

640
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,520
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

641
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,096
CA: As one does.
EM: Yeah.

642
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,096
(Laughter)

643
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,096
In units of 747, a 747 is only about
a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,

644
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,216
so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,

645
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,936
there's 40 747s.

646
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,216
So this would be the thrust equivalent
of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.

647
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,456
CA: And so even with a machine
designed to escape Earth's gravity,

648
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,896
I think you told me last time

649
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,176
this thing could actually
take a fully loaded 747,

650
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,536
people, cargo, everything,

651
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,816
into orbit.

652
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,976
EM: Exactly. This can take
a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,

653
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,496
maximum passengers,
maximum cargo on the 747 --

654
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,760
this can take it as cargo.

655
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,816
CA: So based on this,

656
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,656
you presented recently
this Interplanetary Transport System

657
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,056
which is visualized this way.

658
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,160
This is a scene you picture in, what,
30 years time? 20 years time?

659
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,456
People walking into this rocket.

660
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,056
EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of
an eight- to 10-year time frame.

661
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,456
Aspirationally, that's our target.

662
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,496
Our internal targets
are more aggressive, but I think --

663
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,679
(Laughter)

664
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,815
CA: OK.

665
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,976
EM: While vehicle seems quite large

666
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,176
and is large by comparison
with other rockets,

667
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,176
I think the future spacecraft

668
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,040
will make this look like a rowboat.

669
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,016
The future spaceships
will be truly enormous.

670
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,216
CA: Why, Elon?

671
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:49,376
Why do we need to build a city on Mars

672
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,456
with a million people
on it in your lifetime,

673
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,480
which I think is kind of
what you've said you'd love to do?

674
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,239
EM: I think it's important to have

675
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,856
a future that is inspiring and appealing.

676
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,656
I just think there have to be reasons

677
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:09,616
that you get up in the morning
and you want to live.

678
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,096
Like, why do you want to live?

679
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,856
What's the point? What inspires you?

680
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,736
What do you love about the future?

681
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,256
And if we're not out there,

682
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,296
if the future does not include
being out there among the stars

683
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,016
and being a multiplanet species,

684
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,536
I find that it's incredibly depressing

685
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,896
if that's not the future
that we're going to have.

686
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,096
(Applause)

687
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,456
CA: People want to position this
as an either or,

688
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,176
that there are so many desperate things
happening on the planet now

689
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,640
from climate to poverty
to, you know, you pick your issue.

690
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,016
And this feels like a distraction.

691
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,856
You shouldn't be thinking about this.

692
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,056
You should be solving what's here and now.

693
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,016
And to be fair, you've done
a fair old bit to actually do that

694
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,856
with your work on sustainable energy.

695
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,920
But why not just do that?

696
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,440
EM: I think there's --

697
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,256
I look at the future
from the standpoint of probabilities.

698
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,456
It's like a branching
stream of probabilities,

699
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,480
and there are actions that we can take
that affect those probabilities

700
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,120
or that accelerate one thing
or slow down another thing.

701
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,120
I may introduce something new
to the probability stream.

702
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,016
Sustainable energy
will happen no matter what.

703
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,536
If there was no Tesla,
if Tesla never existed,

704
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,416
it would have to happen out of necessity.

705
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,016
It's tautological.

706
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,696
If you don't have sustainable energy,
it means you have unsustainable energy.

707
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,336
Eventually you will run out,

708
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,176
and the laws of economics
will drive civilization

709
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,856
towards sustainable energy,

710
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,096
inevitably.

711
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,096
The fundamental value
of a company like Tesla

712
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,536
is the degree to which it accelerates
the advent of sustainable energy,

713
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,322
faster than it would otherwise occur.

714
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,336
So when I think, like,

715
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,096
what is the fundamental good
of a company like Tesla,

716
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,816
I would say, hopefully,

717
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,456
if it accelerated that by a decade,
potentially more than a decade,

718
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,616
that would be quite a good thing to occur.

719
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,256
That's what I consider to be

720
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,360
the fundamental
aspirational good of Tesla.

721
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,816
Then there's becoming a multiplanet
species and space-faring civilization.

722
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,776
This is not inevitable.

723
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,496
It's very important to appreciate
this is not inevitable.

724
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,616
The sustainable energy future
I think is largely inevitable,

725
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,376
but being a space-faring civilization
is definitely not inevitable.

726
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,576
If you look at the progress in space,

727
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,200
in 1969 you were able
to send somebody to the moon.

728
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,240
1969.

729
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,736
Then we had the Space Shuttle.

730
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,176
The Space Shuttle could only
take people to low Earth orbit.

731
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,736
Then the Space Shuttle retired,

732
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,160
and the United States
could take no one to orbit.

733
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,576
So that's the trend.

734
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,280
The trend is like down to nothing.

735
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,936
People are mistaken when they think

736
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,056
that technology
just automatically improves.

737
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,976
It does not automatically improve.

738
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,656
It only improves if a lot of people
work very hard to make it better,

739
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,456
and actually it will, I think,
by itself degrade, actually.

740
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,896
You look at great civilizations
like Ancient Egypt,

741
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,856
and they were able to make the pyramids,

742
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,696
and they forgot how to do that.

743
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,536
And then the Romans,
they built these incredible aqueducts.

744
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,760
They forgot how to do it.

745
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,776
CA: Elon, it almost seems,
listening to you

746
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,056
and looking at the different
things you've done,

747
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,856
that you've got this unique
double motivation on everything

748
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,200
that I find so interesting.

749
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,296
One is this desire to work
for humanity's long-term good.

750
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,656
The other is the desire
to do something exciting.

751
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,376
And often it feels like you feel
like you need the one to drive the other.

752
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,496
With Tesla, you want
to have sustainable energy,

753
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,056
so you made these super sexy,
exciting cars to do it.

754
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,776
Solar energy, we need to get there,

755
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,753
so we need to make these beautiful roofs.

756
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:16,976
We haven't even spoken
about your newest thing,

757
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,536
which we don't have time to do,

758
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,896
but you want to save humanity from bad AI,

759
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,216
and so you're going to create
this really cool brain-machine interface

760
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,096
to give us all infinite memory
and telepathy and so forth.

761
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,816
And on Mars, it feels
like what you're saying is,

762
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,536
yeah, we need to save humanity

763
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,936
and have a backup plan,

764
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,216
but also we need to inspire humanity,

765
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,760
and this is a way to inspire.

766
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,456
EM: I think the value
of beauty and inspiration

767
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,456
is very much underrated,

768
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,056
no question.

769
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,336
But I want to be clear.

770
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,176
I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.

771
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,400
That is not the --

772
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,016
I'm just trying to think about the future

773
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,240
and not be sad.

774
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,496
(Applause)

775
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,720
CA: Beautiful statement.

776
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,776
I think everyone here would agree

777
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,000
that it is not --

778
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,856
None of this is going
to happen inevitably.

779
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,536
The fact that in your mind,
you dream this stuff,

780
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,136
you dream stuff that no one else
would dare dream,

781
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,816
or no one else
would be capable of dreaming

782
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,496
at the level of complexity that you do.

783
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,696
The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,
is a really remarkable thing.

784
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,416
Thank you for helping us all
to dream a bit bigger.

785
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,936
EM: But you'll tell me if it ever
starts getting genuinely insane, right?

786
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,456
(Laughter)

787
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,576
CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.
That was really, really fantastic.

788
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,016
That was really fantastic.

789
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,120
(Applause)
