1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Assembling blower

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,720
A bark fiber string is simply used to drive the impeller in a reciprocating manner

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,120
Tuyere is put in place

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,880
25 cm wide, 25 cm deep pit is dug

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,880
Lined with mud

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
Mud and grass

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,040
Building a stack to a height of 25 cm above ground

8
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,180
Fire to help dry it

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,020
Finished furnace

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,080
Stacking charcoal mound with Eucalyptus wood

11
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,220
Sealing top with mud

12
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,580
Lighting mound

13
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,580
Fire burns back down into the mound against the draft

14
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,500
Volatiles exit the top while the wood converts to charcoal

15
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:47,040
When fire reaches the air entries, it's time to seal them with mud to prevent the newly made charcoal from burning

16
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,300
After a 2 hours and 30 minutes the top is sealed and the mound left to cool overnight

17
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,100
The next day the mound is opened and the charcoal  is collected

18
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,480
Partially burnt timber is tossed aside to be reused in the mound next time

19
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,740
Dry mud is returned to the pit to be used next time

20
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,740
Useable charcoal is put into the basket

21
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,340
Charcoal is stored in the smelters hut out of the weather

22
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,720
Ordinary creek on land with normal iron levels

23
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,240
Ordinary iron bacteria (found on all continents) concentrate iron from the water table

24
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,860
Collecting iron bacteria

25
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,220
Add to storage pot

26
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,940
Crushing some charcoal to powder

27
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,920
1:1 ratio by volume of ore to charcoal

28
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,940
Mix with water

29
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,440
Form into 2.5 cm diameter pellets

30
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,660
Dry on furnace

31
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Wood preheat for 30 minutes

32
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,000
Fill with charcoal

33
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,540
Add 10 pellets

34
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,680
Begin blowing furnace

35
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,960
3 hand fulls of charcoal every 7 minutes or so

36
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,820
10 more pellets

37
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,240
More blowing

38
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,120
Final charge added

39
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,640
Whole process took about 3 hours of blowing

40
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,820
Extraction procedure

41
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,280
Hammering slag flat to hopefully flatten iron

42
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Mostly slag

43
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,880
But quite a few prills (small spheres) of iron

44
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,560
These are larger and more abundant than the yields of previous attempts I've made

45
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:23,380
See how the prills form on the surface of the slag. Microscopic pieces of solid/liquid iron must join together as the molten slag flows.

46
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,900
More prills

47
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Separating iron prills from slag

48
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,960
These prills are mainly cast iron or steel due to the high carbon content of the initial ore pellets. Less char powder should be added in future

49
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,220
Iron prills and slag
