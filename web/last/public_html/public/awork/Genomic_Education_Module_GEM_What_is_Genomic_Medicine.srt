00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,500
Welcome to the genomic medicine GEM
produced by the division of genomic

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,259
medicine at UC Davis. This module will
focus on what genomic medicine is, how it

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,888
came to be and a few of the ways that
genomic medicine is impacting the world

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:20,549
we live in. The NHGRI defines genomic
medicine as "An emerging medical

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,140
discipline that involves using genomic
information about an individual as part

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,589
of their clinical care and the health
outcomes and policy implications of

7
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,308
that clinical use".  Let's take a step back
for a moment and reflect on how the

8
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,269
field of genomic medicine came to be,
you've probably heard of the Human

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,890
Genome Project formerly launched in 1990,
the human genome projects goal was to

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,090
determine the sequence of base pairs
that comprise human DNA and to map all

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,079
the genes of the human genome. The
project was determined complete in 2003,

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,520
two years ahead of schedule and it cost
around three billion dollars. At the time

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,690
the project was launched, the belief was
that having the sequence of all 3.3

14
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,099
billion nucleotides in the human genome
would allow us to understand diseases

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,739
such as cancer, diabetes, viruses and
improve in fields such as forensics,

16
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,030
anthropology and agriculture. While it's
true that the completion of the human

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,239
genome project was a huge step in the
right direction for all these fields,

18
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,629
there's still considerable work to be
done to understand and interpret the

19
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,938
genome; for example, one current task at
hand is to identify the genetic variants

20
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,719
that increase the risk for human
diseases, genomic medicine then strives

21
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,618
to utilize genomic information to help
make clinical recommendations to improve

22
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,420
health outcomes. Already genomic medicine
is making a tremendous impact in the

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,280
fields of oncology, pharmacology,
preconception and prenatal, pediatrics

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,560
rare and undiagnosed diseases, infectious
diseases and many more. In the past few

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,090
years there has been a growing push for
personalized or precision medicine to

26
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,640
reach the clinic, where specific
individuals unique genome, epigenome,

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,200
environmental exposure, family history
and other data can be assessed to tailor

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,680
a clinical recommendation to that
patient. Some specific examples of

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,969
applications of precision medicine
include pharmacogenomics which uses

30
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,099
genomic information to ensure that
patients are getting the right dose

31
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,359
of the right drug, cancer and
immunotherapy treatments which target

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,200
specific molecular markers or the
patient's immune system to enhance its

33
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,459
cancer fighting capabilities and
personalized lifestyle plans which

34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,120
utilize genomic information to make
fitness and dietary recommendations

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,289
specific to an individual. Other advances
actively being studied and tested

36
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:36,639
include stem-cell therapy and
regenerative medicine, gene editing

37
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,989
techniques like CRISPR/CAS9 which
allows permanent modification of genes

38
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,120
within organisms, base editing or
chemical surgery which like CRISPR has

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,110
the potential to alter bases in the
genome of an organism, all of these

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,320
methodologies just mentioned are still
emerging and will continue to improve

41
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,549
over time. The field of genomic medicine
is still emerging and very quickly

42
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,230
advancing many academic and research
institutions such as UC Davis now have

43
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:06,939
their own genomic medicine groups. Some
institutions like UC Davis also have or

44
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:10,689
are developing divisions of precision
medicine or precision Diagnostics,

45
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,560
more of these are likely to appear in
the near future. The division of genomic

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,969
medicine at UC Davis aims to combine
clinical information with genomic

47
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:23,409
information to make recommendations and
improve health outcomes. The team of

48
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:27,389
clinical providers consists of medical
geneticists, genetic counselors,

49
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,899
pediatricians, social workers and
dieticians. If you would like to learn
